## Frequently Asked Questions

**Do I have to take the courses in the order specified?**

It is highly recommended to take the courses in the order outlined as most of them build on top of each other?

**Why are you recommending backend courses to frontend developers?**

It's quite simple actually, learning how the backend works on a high level will help you become a better frontend developer.

The backend is a vast field and quite complex but the courses above are meant to give you a hands-on introduction.

**Which courses are a must in order to get a job as a junior frontend developer?**

Good question, Sections 1 and 2 are of course required and the first course in section 3.
After you finish that, you need to practice by building projects, preferably something large to impress recruiters.

You can find many resources on Google on how to build a portfolio as a frontend developer and where to apply for job and prepare for the interview. I won't go into that here as the web is oversaturated with this information and you can easily find it.

Once you get a job and get some hands on experience on a real world project, then you can come back to the list and finish the rest of the courses in the backend section

**What is this DevOps stuff and do I have to care about it?**

As a junior developer, you don't have to care about it. but as you advance in your career, especially if you want to reach Senior level then you need to undertand DevOps, I'd say don't worry about it for now. I have added them here just for completeness.

DevOps will allow you to answer the question: _How do I deploy a large scale application to production and keep it running?_

**This is all great, but how long will take me to finish all these courses?**

This depends on many factors like your problem solving skills and your ability to stay focused for long period of times. but I'd say roughly 8 to 12 months.

**Do I need to know any programming before starting on this path?**

No, absolutley not! This list is meant to take someone who doesn't know anything about programming to being ready for a junior role.

All you need to know is a computer, an internet connection and the determination to learn (a lot)

**Why are you recommending these specific courses?**

Simple really. These courses helped me get a job as a frontend developer without any previous programming experience.

I'm not affiliated with any of the courses providers so this is my honest opinion on them.

**How about a coding bootcamp to become a fullstack developer in 5 weeks?**

I can tell you right off the bat that this is not true. It will take you much longer than 5 weeks.

Bootcamps are good to get you immersed into the field but definitley not enough to land a job, the courses above are complete enough to get you a job (provided that you practiced a lot and build something cool)

**Do I need to have a specific computer?**

No, any computer will do with any operating system.

**Do I need to pay for any tools to use to do programming?**

No, all the tools we use in tech are generally free and you don't have to pay for anything (except the courses above of course)

**I didn't even finish high school, How am I gonna do programming, isn't that hard?**

Well Yes and No, It's hard in the sense it requires determination and focus and long term planning (meaning you will not become a developer overnight, but with time)
and it's not hard in the sense that it doesn't require you to be a colleage grade or have any specific ability, just the ability to sit down (or stand up) and focus!

Anybody can be a programmer with the right determination. Of course it will be easier for some people and harder for some people but anybody can do it.

**why is everything in JavaScript, I heard X is a cool programming langauge?**

Well you heard right, there are many cool programming languages but JavaScript (a scripting language) is the language of the web meaning in order to do frontend you must use JavaScript.
and you can also use it on the backend which is great. 2 birds with one stone.
Once you get a job in the field then you can explore all the languages that you want but for now my recommendation is to start with JavaScript.

**I have another question, can I ask you?**

Sure, you can create an [an issue](https://github.com/YahiaElTai/becoming-a-frontend-developer/issues/new) and I will try to answer as soon as I can.
