## Guideline

- You can apply for a junior position as a fronend developer after finishing sections 1 and 2 and the first course of section 3.
- After you finish the courses for the junior position you need a lot of practice by building a few small projects or one big project as a porfolio to impress recruiters.
- You can come back to the rest of the courses after you get a job and some hands-on experience.
- refer to the [FAQ](/FAQ.md) for more information.

### Notes

---

- Most of the courses on this list are either from [udemy.com](udemy.com) or [coursera.org](coursera.org).
- Courses on Udemy are paid but udemy runs discounts quite regularly.
- Courses on Coursera are free generally, you only have to pay if you need the certifcate (between you and me, you don't need that..).

## Practice

---

None of this means anything if you don't practice on your own by building projects. Following tutorials is great but this is not where most of your learning will happen. You learn by building. Let me repeat that, _You learn by building_.

You can find many ideas on the web on projects to build to practice but here's 2 to get you started:

- [https://github.com/codecrafters-io/build-your-own-x](https://github.com/codecrafters-io/build-your-own-x)
