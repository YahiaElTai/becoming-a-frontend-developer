## Becoming a frontend developer

This guide is meant to be used by anyone interested in becoming a frontend developer

### What is frontend, backend and full-stack?
ðŸ”¥ **Frontend developers** 
    
build the front-end portion of websites and web applicationsâ€”that is, the part that users actually see and interact with. front-end developes create websites and applications using web languages such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript allow users to access and interact with the site or app.

ðŸ”¥ **Backend developers** 
    
are responsible for creating and maintaining the entire back end of a web application. This includes the core application logic, databases, data and application integration, API, and other back end processes.

ðŸ”¥ **Fullstack developer** 
    
is someone who knows both frontend and backend development.


> The easiest way to get into the tech industry is frontend which is what this guide suggests and then once.

you advance in your career you can choose to stay on the frontend, move to the backend or become a full-stack developer.

### How to use this guide

This guide is divided into 4 sections (areas of code) spanning over 3 levels (Junior, Mid-level and Senior) of frontend development

Each level is color coded:
- Junior ðŸŸ¢
- Mid-level ðŸŸ¡
- Senior ðŸ”´ 

#### Steps to follow 
1) Go through all the courses marked as junior in all the sections following the order described.
2) Build your resume and a strong portfolio and get a job as a *junior frontend developer*
   - You need a lot of practice by building a few small projects or one big project as a porfolio to impress recruiters.
   - Do not waste time with any more courses, get a job!
3) Congrats on the job! As soon as you feel slightly comfortable at your job (6 months to a year) come back to this guide and finish all courses marked as Mid-level in all the sections
   - By the time you finish those courses you would have been at your company for about 2 to 3 years and probably gotten promoted to Mid-level frontend developer
4) After 2 to 3 years of experience you can come back to this guide again and finish all the courses marked as senior in all the sections
   -  By the time you finished the courses marked as senior you would have been at your company for 4 to 5 years and probably gotten promoted to senior frontend developer
   -  You are now a senior frontend developer but also a mid-level full-stack JavaScript developer 
   -  You can choose to stay on the frontend side and become more senior or move to the backend or full-stack.
   -  Note that at this stage you are a senior frontend but not necessarily a senior backend or a senior full-stack developer (getting to that would require experience building full-stack apps or backend apps)

**Notes about the courses**

- Most of the courses on this list are either from [udemy.com](udemy.com) or [coursera.org](coursera.org).
- Courses on Udemy are paid but udemy runs discounts quite regularly.
- Courses on Coursera are free generally, you only have to pay if you need the certifcate (between you and me, you don't need that..).

### Practice

None of this means anything if you don't practice on your own by building projects. Following tutorials is great but this is not where most of your learning will happen. You learn by building. Let me repeat that, _You learn by building_.

You can find many ideas on the web on projects to build to practice but here's 2 to get you started:
